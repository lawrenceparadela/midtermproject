            <h2>My Life</h2>
            <p>I am a 19-year-old boy residing in the vibrant city of <span>Cebu</span>, nestled in the heart of <span>Philippines</span>. I come from a close-knit family of five, consisting of my loving parents, my two supportive sisters, and myself.</p>
    <p>Growing up, our household was always filled with laughter, lively conversations, and occasional sibling rivalries and some heavy family quarell, but above all, it was characterized by an unbreakable bond of love and companionship. Despite the hustle and bustle of daily life, my family and I always make time to enjoy shared activities, whether it's cooking together, playing board games, or embarking on outdoor adventures.</p>
    <p>In my leisure hours, I indulge in various hobbies such as playing, finding solace and inspiration in these creative pursuits. As I navigate through the complexities of my young adulthood, I am grateful for the unwavering support of my family and the myriad experiences that shape my journey, guiding me towards self-discovery, personal growth, and the pursuit of my dreams.</p>
