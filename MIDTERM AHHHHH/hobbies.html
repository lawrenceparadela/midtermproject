            <h2> Hobbies I Genuinely Enjoy</h2>
            
            <li> Soccer </li><img src ="./img/download.jpg" class = "scr" alt = "Dota 2">
                <p>I have been passionate about soccer since I was a child. From playing in local leagues to watching international matches, soccer has always been an integral part of my life. I love the adrenaline rush of running across the field, the thrill of scoring goals, and the camaraderie among teammates. Whether it's a friendly kickabout with friends or a competitive match, soccer brings me joy and fulfillment. The lessons I've learned on the field, such as teamwork, discipline, and perseverance, have also shaped my character and contributed to my personal growth.</p>
            
            <li> Dota 2</li><img src ="./img/AM.jpeg" class = "am" alt = "Dota 2">
                <p>As a dedicated gamer, Dota 2 is more than just a game to me; it's a complex world of strategy, teamwork, and competition. I've spent countless hours mastering different heroes, refining my skills, and strategizing with teammates to achieve victory. The fast-paced action, ever-changing meta, and intense matches keep me hooked, constantly pushing me to improve and adapt. Whether I'm climbing the ranks in ranked matches or participating in local tournaments, Dota 2 provides me with endless excitement and challenges. Beyond the thrill of victory, Dota 2 has also taught me valuable lessons in leadership, communication, and adaptability, skills that are invaluable both in-game and in real life.</p>
            
            <li>Chess </li>  <img src="./img/chess.jpg" class = "chess" alt="Chess">
                <p>Chess is not just a game; it's a mental exercise, a test of patience, and a source of intellectual stimulation. I discovered my love for chess at a young age and have been captivated by its intricacies ever since. As a varsity chess player representing USJ-R, I've had the privilege of competing in numerous tournaments, facing off against skilled opponents, and honing my strategic thinking on the board. Each game of chess teaches me valuable lessons in planning, foresight, and decision-making, enriching my mind and sharpening my skills. Beyond the competitive aspect, chess also serves as a form of meditation for me, allowing me to focus my mind, sharpen my concentration, and explore the depths of strategic thinking.</p>
